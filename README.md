# roughenough-fuzz

[![Apache License 2](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ASF2-blue.svg)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt)

This crate is for fuzzing [Roughenough](https://github.com/int08h/roughenough), a Rust
implementation of the [Roughtime](https://roughtime.googlesource.com/roughtime) secure time 
synchronization protocol. 

## Building and Installation

Fuzzing uses [American fuzzy lop](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) via [afl.rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/afl.rs),
[libFuzzer](http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html) via [cargo-fuzz](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/cargo-fuzz),
and [honggfuzz](http://honggfuzz.com/) via [honggfuzz-rs](https://github.com/rust-fuzz/honggfuzz-rs).

**Rust Nightly** is needed to compile this crate. The nightly-only `-Z` compiler flag is required
by `cargo-fuzz`. MacOS users also need nightly to compile `afl.rs`.

To install:

* `cargo install afl cargo-fuzz honggfuzz`

FYI, Ubuntu 17.10 needed the `binutils-dev` and `libunwind-dev` packages to compile cargo-fuzz. YMMV.

## Running

```
$ cd roughenough-fuzz

# Run AFL
$ cargo afl build --release --bin afl_target
$ cargo afl fuzz -i in -o out -x dictionary.txt target/release/afl_target

# Run libFuzzer
$ cargo fuzz run -O fuzz_target_1 -- -dict=dictionary.txt -max_len=2048

# Run honggfuzz
$ HFUZZ_RUN_ARGS="--dict dictionary.txt --max_file_size 2048 --input in/" cargo hfuzz run hfuzz_target
```
